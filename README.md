# VBA-Challenge

In this Script I have creates a Loop through all the stocks for each year(2014-2016) and the following information was created:
 
 Ticker Symbol 
  
  Yearly Change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of the year
  
  % Change 
  
  Total stock value 

The Yearly Change is also color coded for red in negative change and green in positive 

My script also returns the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume" of each year.
